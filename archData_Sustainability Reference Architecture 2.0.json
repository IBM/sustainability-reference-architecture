Reference Architecture</strong> The sustainability reference architecture diagram will illustrate how various software applications supporting different business segments can work together to assist customers in achieving their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals. The diagram depicts the various data sources that capture sustainability information critical for producing corporate sustainability reports and how these data sources are collected, assembled, analyzed, and reported.  These processes are essential for ensuring an enterprise operates to support the organization's sustainability goals. Furthermore, the reference architecture highlights the importance of these data sources for not only tracking and reporting but also for operationalizing ESG goals through the implementation of corrective actions powered by artificial intelligence applications.
