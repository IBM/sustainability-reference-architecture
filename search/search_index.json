The diagram depicts the various data sources that capture sustainability information critical for producing corporate sustainability reports and how these data sources are collected, assembled, analyzed, and reported. These processes are essential for ensuring an enterprise operates to support the organization's sustainability goals. Furthermore, the reference architecture highlights the importance of these data sources for not only tracking and reporting but also for operationalizing ESG goals through the implementation of corrective actions powered by artificial intelligence applications. The image below illustrates the journey of sustainability operations. To achieve sustainable operations, companies need to embark on a journey that starts with a strategy and roadmap, with ESG data reporting being a critical aspect. It all starts with developing a strategy and roadmap, and ESG data reporting is critical. IBM Consulting and business partners can help customers in this regard, while the Envizi application can assist with ESG reporting. The journey will vary depending on the customer's current state, priorities, and goals. For example, the next step in the above journey map is intelligent asset and facility infrastructure, where IBM Maximo and TRIRIGA applications can help reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions. The next step in the journey addresses scope 3 carbon emissions, which the IBM Supply chain intelligence suite application can help with. Climate risk mitigation may be the next logical step depending on the type of industry. The final step is to reduce emissions from I.T. systems using responsible computing and Green IT, where IBM products like Turbonomic, Z16, and IBM Cloud can play a role. No matter what options customers choose, IBM has a solution that can help them achieve their sustainability goals.
