The diagram depicts the various data sources that capture sustainability information critical for producing corporate sustainability reports and how these data sources are collected, assembled, analyzed, and reported. These processes are essential for ensuring an enterprise operates to support the organization's sustainability goals. Furthermore, the reference architecture highlights the importance of these data sources for not only tracking and reporting but also for operationalizing ESG goals through the implementation of corrective actions powered by artificial intelligence applications. The image below illustrates the journey of sustainability operations. To achieve sustainable operations, companies need to embark on a journey that starts with a strategy and roadmap, with ESG data reporting being a critical aspect. It all starts with developing a strategy and roadmap, and ESG data reporting is critical. IBM Consulting and business partners can help customers in this regard, while the Envizi application can assist with ESG reporting. The journey will vary depending on the customer's current state, priorities, and goals. For example, the next step in the above journey map is intelligent asset and facility infrastructure, where IBM Maximo and TRIRIGA applications can help reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions. The next step in the journey addresses data and scope 3 carbon emissions, which the IBM Supply chain intelligence suite application.

Connector Connector refers to a device or software that allows different devices or systems to communicate and exchange data with each other. Connectors enable the interoperability of different devices and systems, allowing them to work together and share data over a network. Data Model A data model is a way of organizing and representing data in a computer system. It defines the structure and relationships between different data pieces and serves as a blueprint for how the data will be stored and accessed. Efficiency Finder Application to identify and analyze the efficiency of assets within an asset management system. This may include identifying opportunities for improving the performance or efficiency of the asset, as well as identifying potential problems or inefficiencies that could impact its performance. Environmental Data Environmental data refers to information that is collected about the natural environment and its various components, such as air, water, soil, plants, etc. This data can be collected using various methods, including field observations, remote sensing, and laboratory analysis, and it can be used to understand and monitor the health and functioning of the environment. ERP Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are software platforms that are designed to help organizations manage and integrate their business processes, such as finance, accounting, human resources, procurement, and supply chain management. ESG Reporting Frameworks ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reporting frameworks are guidelines or standards that organizations can use to report on their environmental, social, and governance performance, risks, and impacts. Financials Financial include various metrics, such as revenue, profits, expenses, cash flow, assets, liabilities, and equity. GHG Protocol GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. Green Leases Green leases are leases for commercial or residential properties that include provisions related to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. These provisions may require the tenant or property owner to take certain actions to reduce their environmental impact, such as using energy-efficient appliances or implementing water conservation measures. Intelligent Maintenance Application for managing and maintaining assets that use data and analytics to predict when maintenance is needed. This approach is designed to optimize the maintenance schedule for an asset based on its actual condition, rather than following a predetermined schedule or reacting to failures. IT Optimization Services Maximize the efficiency and sustainability of an organization's I.T. infrastructure and operations. Locations Location refers to the physical location of devices, sensors, and other assets connected to the network.

These rules can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including data validation, transformation, aggregation, and analysis. REST API REST API (short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that allows software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. REST APIs use a standard set of protocols and data formats to exchange information between applications, allowing them to communicate and share data in a consistent and predictable manner. SASB SASB Standards guide the disclosure of financially material sustainability information by companies to their investors. Science Based Targets The Science Based Targets initiative is a collaboration between the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Since 2015 more than 1,000 companies have joined the initiative to set a science-based climate target Scope 1, 2 GHG Accounting + Reporting Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions are categories used to classify and report the greenhouse gas emissions of an organization. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that are under the control of an organization, such as emissions from company-owned vehicles or equipment. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that result from an organization's consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating, or cooling. Scope 3 GHG Accounting + Reporting Scope 3 GHG (greenhouse gas) accounting and reporting refers to the measurement, accounting, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are not directly owned or controlled by an organization, but that are related to its activities.
