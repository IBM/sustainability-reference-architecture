The suite allows users to sign on to a single, integrated platform to access key monitoring, maintenance, and reliability applications across the business. Not only does it help remove data silos, but it also enhances data sharing with integrated user experience and shared administrative controls for enterprise-scale execution. The Intelligent Asset Reference Architecture is a building block for complimentary solution architectures for applications as part of the suite. Key asset management capabilities within the suite include: managing, monitoring, evaluating health, predicting failures, and visual inspection, to name a few. Customers can start at any point in the asset lifecycle and expand into other areas. A depiction of the intelligent asset journey is in the image below. This flexibility uses a simplified, suite-based licensing structure and does not require additional provisioning. Through Red Hat OpenShift and hybrid cloud deployment, provisioning the suite across multiple clouds, on-premises, or hosted as a managed service on IBM Cloud is achievable. The Intelligent Asset Reference Architecture is core to the overall suite of applications. Therefore, the current and future approach to documenting Intelligent Asset architectures is as follows: Intelligent Asset Reference Architecture (core) Intelligent Asset Inspection Architecture (Phase 1: Visual Inspection) Intelligent Asset Insights Architecture (Phase 2: Monitor, Health, Predict) Intelligent Asset Mobile Application Architecture (Phase 3: Mobile) Intelligent Asset Safety Architecture (Phase 3: Safety) Intelligent Asset Assistance Architecture (Phase 3: Assist) In Phase 1 of this project, the Intelligent Asset Inspection Technology Pattern includes a complementary Intelligent Asset Inspection solution architecture as part of this Intelligent Asset Reference Architecture (core). The purpose of a technology pattern is to codify existing design knowledge so that specialists and architects are not constantly reinventing the wheel. With Intelligent Assets, customers achieve sustainable asset management and reliability optimization. They can enable the creation of resilient and sustainable infrastructure and operations to extend the life of equipment, buildings, bridges, fleets, water lines, and more to reach sustainability targets. The most popular use cases for the suite include but are not limited to: Asset Management & Maintenance: Optimize maintenance schedules to achieve efficient, safe, and sustainable work practices. Asset Reliability and Optimization: Extending asset life decreases waste & embodied carbon and improves energy efficiency. Asset Monitoring and Fault Detection: Increased energy efficiency, equipment performance, and reliability.

Cloud Pak for Data consists of a control plane, which has its own user interface and its own set of authorized users. After you install Cloud Pak for Data into Red Hat OpenShift cluster and you log in as an administrator, you can install one or more Cloud Pak for Data services into the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. In particular, you can use it to install the DB2 Warehouse that is used by the Maximo Monitor and IoT applications. The Maximo Application Suite license entitles you to install and use a number of theCloud Pak for Data services, provided you are using them with Maximo Application Suite applications. Maximo Application Suite Core Start by installing a control plane, Maximo Application Suite core, into Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Use Maximo Application Suite core to install and manage the Maximo Application Suite applications, industry solutions, and add-ons that you want to use. Maximo Application Suite core maintains a registry of users. You can specify which users are to be permitted to access which Maximo Application Suite applications. Maximo Application Suite Prerequisites Maximo Application Suite applications have several dependencies or prerequisites. Some of these are required regardless of which applications you use, others are use by specific applications. Choose whether to deploy prerequisites in the Red Hat OpenShift cluster or run them externally,either in a separate Red Hat OpenShift cluster, or by using an external service provider. OpenShift The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is managed by a set of master nodes. These master nodes run the Kubernetes cluster control software, managing what runs on the other nodes in the cluster (the worker nodes). The master nodes also maintain an internal database (etcd) of containing the Kubernetes resource definitions. To ensure continuous and high availability of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses a minimum of three master nodes.

Cloud Pak for Data consists of a control plane, which has its own user interface and its own set of authorized users. After you install Cloud Pak for Data into Red Hat OpenShift cluster and you log in as an administrator, you can install one or more Cloud Pak for Data services into the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. In particular, you can use it to install the DB2 Warehouse that is used by the Maximo Monitor and IoT applications. The Maximo Application Suite license entitles you to install and use a number of theCloud Pak for Data services, provided you are using them with Maximo Application Suite applications. Maximo Application Suite Core Start by installing a control plane, Maximo Application Suite core, into Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Use Maximo Application Suite core to install and manage the Maximo Application Suite applications, industry solutions, and add-ons that you want to use. Maximo Application Suite core maintains a registry of users. You can specify which users are to be permitted to access which Maximo Application Suite applications.
