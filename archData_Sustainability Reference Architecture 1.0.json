segments can work together to assist customers in achieving their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals.&nbsp;The diagram depicts the various data sources that capture sustainability information critical for producing corporate sustainability reports and how these data sources are collected, assembled, analyzed, and reported.&nbsp;\n\nThese processes are essential for ensuring an enterprise operates to support the organization's sustainability goals. Furthermore, the reference architecture highlights the importance of these data sources for not only tracking and reporting but also for operationalizing ESG goals through the implementation of corrective actions powered by artificial intelligence applications.

IBM Consulting and business partners can help customers in this regard, while the Envizi application can assist with ESG reporting. <br><br>The journey will vary depending on the customer's current state, priorities, and goals. For example, the next step in the above journey map is intelligent asset and facility infrastructure, where IBM Maximo and TRIRIGA applications can help reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions. <br><br>The next step in the journey addresses scope 3 carbon emissions, which the IBM Supply chain intelligence suite application can help with. <br><br>Climate risk mitigation may be the next logical step depending on the type of industry. <br><br>The final step is to reduce emissions from I.T. systems using responsible computing and Green IT, where IBM products like Turbonomic, Z16, and IBM Cloud can play a role. <br><br><div>No matter what options customers choose, IBM has a solution that can help them achieve their sustainability goals.

However, they often struggle to achieve these goals using silo systems that do not share data, are difficult to integrate, and are expensive to operate. This lack of integration and data sharing makes it hard for businesses to track their progress and hinders their ability to achieve their carbon reduction targets.<b> </b>To address this challenge, businesses need a simple, user-friendly software solution to help operationalize their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals, streamline their efforts to reduce emissions, and provide real-time visibility into their progress toward meeting their reduction targets.<br><br>"},"functionalRequirements":[{"_id":"functionalrequirement_H1lZ6Bmm72_XKAu2HQcU","id":"AM 1","name":"Asset operations anomaly detection with actionable insight","description":"Asset operations anomaly detection with actionable insight is a use case in which organizations implement advanced analytics tools to identify unusual behavior in asset performance and take corrective actions.
