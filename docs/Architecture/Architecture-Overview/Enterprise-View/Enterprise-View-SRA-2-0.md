### Subsystem(s)

| Name | Description | Sub-Diagram |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asset Management | The asset management layer allows customers to enable sustainability centric planning, operation, and management of their complex physical assets.&nbsp;<br> |  |
| Climate Risk | The climate risk layer allows customers to identify, track, manage and mitigate climate-based risks [for example - temperature, humidity, precipitation, frost etc.] |  |
| Facility Management | The facility management layer allows customers to enable sustainability-centric facilities management through various facility life cycle [acquire, build, manage, utilize, maintain and dispose of]. |  |
| Integration | The integration layer is the first stage in consuming information from the physical layer and will provide the interface to data and/or functionality of one or more sustainability applications.&nbsp;<br> |  |
| Physical | The physical layer is the foundation system of the Sustainability architecture where the data gets generated and stored.&nbsp;<br> |  |
| Supply Chain Circularity | The Supply Chain Circularity Layer allows customers to minimize the costs and amount of carbon emissions generated by supply chain activities <br> |  |
| AI & Analytics | The AI &amp; Analytics layer allows customers to sift through their sustainability application data points and extract valuable insights.  |  |
| Data Mapping and Storage | The data layer will help to store, standardize and normalize data in a meaningful[example - relationship between data] way that sustainability applications can consume.&nbsp;<br> |  |
| ESG Framework | The ESG Reporting Framework lets customers establish goals, and report on those goals to meet regulatory requirements including auditability.  Also, it allows customers to get insights into where organizations can make changes to improve their sustainability posture. <br> |  |
| ESG Reporting | The ESG platform layer allows customers to get deep visibility into environmental, human, and governance risks.  |  |
| Green IT | <p>Green IT focuses on optimizing technology infrastructure and operations to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste, and lower carbon emissions.</p> |  |
| Sustainable Design | <p>Sustainable design integrates environmental considerations into every phase of the product lifecycle, optimizing resource efficiency, minimizing environmental impact, and ensuring long-term sustainability in product development and operations.</p> |  |
