     | Advancing Net Zero | Advancing Net Zero is WorldGBC's global program working towards total sector decarbonization by 2050 |
     | Climate Risk Map | A climate risk map is a visual representation of the potential risks and impacts of climate change on a particular region or area. <br> |
     | Connector | Connector refers to a device or software that allows different devices or systems to communicate and exchange data with each other. Connectors enable the interoperability of different devices and systems, allowing them to work together and share data over a network.<br> |
     | Data Model | A data model is a way of organizing and representing data in a computer system. It defines the structure and relationships between different data pieces and serves as a blueprint for how the data will be stored and accessed.<br> |
     | Efficiency Finder | Application to identify and analyze the efficiency of assets within an asset management system. This may include identifying opportunities for improving the performance or efficiency of the asset, as well as identifying potential problems or inefficiencies that could impact its performance.<br> |
     | Environmental Data | Environmental data refers to information that is collected about the natural environment and its various components, such as air, water, soil, plants, etc. This data can be collected using various methods, including field observations, remote sensing, and laboratory analysis, and it can be used to understand and monitor the health and functioning of the environment.<br> |
