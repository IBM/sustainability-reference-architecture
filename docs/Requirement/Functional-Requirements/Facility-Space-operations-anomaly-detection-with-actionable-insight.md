| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
 | Connector | Connector refers to a device or software that allows different devices or systems to communicate and exchange data with each other. Connectors enable the interoperability of different devices and systems, allowing them to work together and share data over a network.<br> |
     | GHG Protocol | GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. |
     | ERP | Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are software platforms that are designed to help organizations manage and integrate their business processes, such as finance, accounting, human resources, procurement, and supply chain management.<br> |
     | ESG Reporting Frameworks | ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reporting frameworks are guidelines or standards that organizations can use to report on their environmental, social, and governance performance, risks, and impacts. <br> |
     | Processing Rules | Processing rules in data systems refer to the set of instructions or algorithms that are used to manipulate and process data within the system. These rules can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including data validation, transformation, aggregation, and analysis.<br> |
     | Sustainability Program Tracking | Sustainability program tracking is the process of monitoring and measuring the progress and performance of a sustainability program or initiative. <br> |
     | Scope 1, 2 GHG Accounting + Reporting | Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions are categories used to classify and report the greenhouse gas emissions of an organization. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that are under the control of an organization, such as emissions from company-owned vehicles or equipment. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that result from an organization's consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating, or cooling.<br> |
