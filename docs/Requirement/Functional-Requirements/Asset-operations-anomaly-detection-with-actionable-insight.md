#  AM 1 - Asset operations anomaly detection with actionable insight



### Description

Asset operations anomaly detection with actionable insight is a use case in which organizations implement advanced analytics tools to identify unusual behavior in asset performance and take corrective actions. These capabilities help improve asset efficiency, reduce downtime, and minimize the negative impact of asset operations on the environment.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
 | Connector | Connector refers to a device or software that allows different devices or systems to communicate and exchange data with each other. Connectors enable the interoperability of different devices and systems, allowing them to work together and share data over a network.<br> |
     | Data Model | A data model is a way of organizing and representing data in a computer system. It defines the structure and relationships between different data pieces and serves as a blueprint for how the data will be stored and accessed.<br> |
     | GHG Protocol | GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. |
     | Intelligent Maintenance | Application for managing and maintaining assets that use data and analytics to predict when maintenance is needed. This approach is designed to optimize the maintenance schedule for an asset based on its actual condition, rather than following a predetermined schedule or reacting to failures.<br> |
     | Pattern Detection | Pattern detection rules are a set of guidelines or criteria that are used to identify and classify patterns in data. <br>Example - Anomaly detection |
     | REST API | REST API (short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that allows software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. REST APIs use a standard set of protocols and data formats to exchange information between applications, allowing them to communicate and share data in a consistent and predictable manner.<br> |
     | Scope 1, 2 GHG Accounting + Reporting | Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions are categories used to classify and report the greenhouse gas emissions of an organization. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that are under the control of an organization, such as emissions from company-owned vehicles or equipment. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that result from an organization's consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating, or cooling.<br> |
     | Storage | Storage refers to the physical or virtual space where data is saved and stored for later use. Storage is an essential part of any data system, enabling it to retain and access data over time.<br> |
