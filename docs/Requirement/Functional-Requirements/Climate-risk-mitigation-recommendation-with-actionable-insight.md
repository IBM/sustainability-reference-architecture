| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
 | Geospatial Analytics | Geospatial analytics is the analysis of spatial data to understand and visualize patterns, trends, and relationships in a geographic context.<br> |
     | Connector | Connector refers to a device or software that allows different devices or systems to communicate and exchange data with each other. Connectors enable the interoperability of different devices and systems, allowing them to work together and share data over a network.<br> |
     | Pattern Detection Rules | Pattern detection rules are a set of guidelines or criteria that are used to identify and classify patterns in data. <br> |
     | Climate Risk Map | A climate risk map is a visual representation of the potential risks and impacts of climate change on a particular region or area. <br> |
     | GHG Protocol | GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. |
     | Environmental Data | Environmental data refers to information that is collected about the natural environment and its various components, such as air, water, soil, plants, etc. This data can be collected using various methods, including field observations, remote sensing, and laboratory analysis, and it can be used to understand and monitor the health and functioning of the environment.<br> |
     | REST API | REST API (short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that allows software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. REST APIs use a standard set of protocols and data formats to exchange information between applications, allowing them to communicate and share data in a consistent and predictable manner.<br> |
     | Scope 1, 2 GHG Accounting + Reporting | Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions are categories used to classify and report the greenhouse gas emissions of an organization. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that are under the control of an organization, such as emissions from company-owned vehicles or equipment. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that result from an organization's consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating, or cooling.<br> |
     | Processing Rules | Processing rules in data systems refer to the set of instructions or algorithms that are used to manipulate and process data within the system. These rules can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including data validation, transformation, aggregation, and analysis.<br> |
     | ESG Reporting Frameworks | ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reporting frameworks are guidelines or standards that organizations can use to report on their environmental, social, and governance performance, risks, and impacts. <br> |
