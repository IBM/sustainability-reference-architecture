<b>Business Challenge: Achieving Carbon Emission Reduction Goals</b><br>Many businesses face the challenge of achieving rigorous carbon emission reduction goals to meet the demands of various stakeholders, regulators, and peers. However, they often struggle to achieve these goals using silo systems that do not share data, are difficult to integrate, and are expensive to operate. This lack of integration and data sharing makes it hard for businesses to track their progress and hinders their ability to achieve their carbon reduction targets.<b> </b>To address this challenge, businesses need a simple, user-friendly software solution to help operationalize their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals, streamline their efforts to reduce emissions, and provide real-time visibility into their progress toward meeting their reduction targets.<br><br>
